                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Kevin, im currently in my 4th year in the B-Tech Automation engineering program at McMaster University. 
                    Some of my favourite things to do on my own time is play games, hangout with friends and play volleyball. I come from a family of 4 
                    and have a little sister that is about to graduate highschool. What made me decide on the B-Tech Automation program was the fact that I 
                    have always been intrested in technology and hands on learning.
